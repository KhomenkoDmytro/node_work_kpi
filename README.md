I have chosen <strong>Express</strong> because it is most popular framework, so it may have more educational resourses for begginers.<br/> 
I use <strong>JavaScript</strong> because the project must be done in Ð° short time and I`m famaliar with this language better than with TypeScript.
<br/> Preetier is chosen for formatting.<br/>
